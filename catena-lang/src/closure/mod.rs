//! Closure conversion
//!
//! Given an AnnotatedTerm f containing a node n with closure type A => B,
//! identify its "smuggled environment" X, and produce:
//!
//! 1. A new term `closure.f.n : X ● A -> B`
//! 2. A modified `f` whose closure is replaced by `closure.f.n`

// NOTE: this is really doing rewriting internally.
// In future, we should integrate using 'proper' rewrite machinery, rather than reimplementing it
// ad-hoc here.

// Identifies a region of an AnnotatedTerm corresponding to a (bounded) closure
pub(crate) mod region;

// Create an AnnotatedTerm `t` corresponding to a subregion identified by `region`
pub(crate) mod extract;

// From the extracted AnnotatedTerm create `closure.f.n` as `(f × id_A) ; evaluate`,
// where `evaluate` is the (inlined) body of cmc.hex's evaluate.
pub(crate) mod body;

// Replace an identified closure region with a caller-provided body.
pub(crate) mod rewrite;

// Integrate region identification, extraction, body construction, and rewrite.
pub mod convert;
